## Overview
This project implements a 4-bit calculator using combinational logic circuits to perform arithmetic operations on binary numbers. The circuit is designed to take two 4-bit binary numbers as input and perform one of the four main arithmetic operations. The results are displayed on a 7-segment display along with carry, zero, sign, and overflow flags.

## Usage Guide
1. Download and install Proteus Circuit Simulation Software.
2. Download and open the Proteus project file included in the repository to your computer. Once the project is open, you will see the circuit diagram of the 4-bit calculator logic circuit. 
3. Set the input numbers for the arithmetic operation by changing the values of the four switches labeled "A3", "A2", "A1", and "A0" for the first 4-bit binary number and "B3", "B2", "B1", and "B0" for the second 4-bit binary number. Each switch can be set to either 0 or 1 to indicate the corresponding binary digit of the input.
4. Select the arithmetic operation you want to perform by changing the value of the "Operation" switch. The options are "Addition", "Subtraction", "Multiplication", and "Unsigned Division".
5. Simulate the circuit by clicking on the "Play" button on the toolbar. This will run the simulation and display the result of the arithmetic operation on the 7-segment display.
